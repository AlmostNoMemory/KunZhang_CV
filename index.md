## Research Experience

### **UAV-based 5G Base Station Fault Detection** `2020.11 -`

_Utilize the drone to fly around the 5g base station to detect whether the base station has damaged parts and whether there ar debris that interferes with the normal operation of the base station._
- Developed the drone flight algorithm that automatically circumnavigates the 5G Base Station. 
- All the data capture by the drone then will be stored in the cloud and be processed by deep learning fault detection algorithm.

<br>

### **Chinese Character Strokes Extraction Based on Reinforcement Learning**  `2020.10 -`

_Research Projects:._
- Combined deep reinforcement learning algorithm **DQN** with **transformer** to extract the chinese character strokes by given external reward.
- Designed the reward function and conduct the experiment of training DQN agent.

<br>

### **Self-driving Car Construction and Research**  `2020.9 -`

_This project is about building up a self-driving car for developing an intelligent algorithm._

- Responsible for the overall construction of the vehicle, including the chassis part and various sensors: lidar, depth camera, imu and gps. 
- Based on robot operating system, integrated a series of functions such as chassis communication, chassis control, and sensor data acquisition.


<br>

### **Robot-based human-computer interaction system for autistic children** `2020.6 - 2020.9`

_This project designed a robot that can interact with autistic children based on their expressions and movements._

- Devepoled the facial expression recognition function of autistic children using deep nerual network. 
- Devepoled the communication function between the robot and the recognition system.


<br>

### **Mushroom feature size automatic calculation website**  `2019.6 - 2019.8`
- Designed a picture-based size calculation algorithm. 
- Built up the website where users upload photos of mushrooms, and the feature size of mushroom can be automatically calculated.
