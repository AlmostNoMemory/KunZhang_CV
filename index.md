## Research Experience

### **UAV-based 5G Base Station Fault Detection** `2020.9 -`

Developed a drone flight algorithm that automatically circumnavigates the 5G Base Station. All the data capture by the drone then will be stored in the cloud and be processed by deep learning fault detection algorithm.

<br>

### **Chinese Character Extraction Based on Reinforcement Learning**  `2020.10 -`
Using deep reinforcement learning algorithm DQN to extract the Chinese Character. Design the reward function and conduct the experiment of training DQN agent.

<br>

### **Robot-based human-computer interaction system for autistic children** `2020.6 - 2020.9`
_The project designed a robot that can interact with autistic children based on their expressions and movements._

I devepoled the facial expression recognition function of autistic children and the communication function between the robot and the recognition system.


<br>

### **Mushroom size automatic calculation website**  `2019.6 - 2019.8`
Designed a picture-based size calculation algorithm, built up a website where users upload photos of mushrooms, and the feature size can be automatically calculated.
